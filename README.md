### Lazy Loading with Chunks ‚ö°

1. Implement React.lazy() and Suspense:

- Use React.lazy() for dynamic component imports and Suspense for handling loading states. This enables components to load only when needed.

2. Configure with React Router v6:

- Set up routes in React Router v6 to work with lazy-loaded components. This approach helps in loading each route's component as a separate chunk.

3. Optimize Component and Module Loading:

- Load components and their associated modules in chunks. Use Webpack for efficient chunk creation to reduce initial load time and improve performance.

4. Enhance Performance and User Experience:

- By using lazy loading with chunks, improve application speed and responsiveness, particularly on slower connections, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Compound Component Pattern üì¶

1.  Composition-based Design:

- Utilizes composition over inheritance for building flexible and reusable component structures.

2. Shared State and Context:

- Leverages React's context API to share state and functionality implicitly among related components.

3. Parent-Child Relationship:

- Involves a parent component managing shared state and child components using that state.

4. Customizable UI:

- Offers enhanced control and customization of UI elements by allowing rearrangement and adjustment of child components.

### Extensible Styles Pattern üíÖ

1. Modular and Reusable Styles

- Utilizes modular CSS or CSS-in-JS to create reusable and extendable style components.

2. Props-based Customization

- Leverages props to customize styles, allowing dynamic styling based on component state or parent input.

3. Composition of Styles

- Encourages composition of style objects or functions for scalable and maintainable styling.

### Control Props Pattern üïπÔ∏è

1. Controlled Component State

- Involves passing state management to parent components, making child components controlled by the parent.

2. Props as Handlers

- Parent components pass callback functions as props to handle child component state changes.

3. Enhanced Predictability

- Facilitates a more predictable and controlled flow of data, enabling parent components to manage and manipulate child component behavior.
